# Gopen Web API - free your data seamlessly with GDAL ogr2ogr
## DO NOT USE, IT'S NOT PROD READY.

Open-data initiatives are becoming the norm for all government agencies worldwide.
Major cities are offering datasets to help foster innovation, create new markets,
increasing transparency and citizen engagement.

Accessibility is a real concern here: We want our data to be used, crunched and mashed-up
in ways never imagined by our marketing dept. For this to happen at large scale,
we must not expose proprietary/internal formats to the public.

This project aims to help gov-agencies to free their data in any formats
by exposing a simple REST API to convert their datasets in many formats and projections.
It is built on [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) and
requires [GDAL ogr2ogr](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html).
